# Suicide_Rate_Forecasting
Abstract
Suicide is a significant public health concern that affects individuals, families, and communities. In this project, we will explore the trends and patterns in suicide rates from 1985 to 2021. Through our analysis, we will gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to suicide and the populations that are most at risk. By providing an overview of the current state of suicide rates, this project aims to raise awareness and support efforts to prevent suicide.Countries are becoming more and more developed and people have more access to basic goods. There are many other factors deciding why gender plays such a big role. For example, we know that men are more likely to supress their feelings and are on average more violent, leading them to opt for more violent solutions to their problems. With age comes loneliness, the older you are and if you don't have a family, the higher chance that the people you love will be out of your life by then.
